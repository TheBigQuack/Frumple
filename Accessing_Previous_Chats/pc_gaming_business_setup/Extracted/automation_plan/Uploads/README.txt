‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/ (AttractMode or EmulationStation)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ logs/ (usage tracking, audit)
```

### üì¶ C. Emulator Deployment (Container/VM-ready)

| Emulator    | Platform     | Container Option   | Notes                     |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| RetroArch   | Multi-system | Yes (via Docker)   | libretro core-based       |
| MAME        | Arcade       | Yes                | Supports arcade cabinets  |

## ‚úÖ SECTION 3: AUTOMATION & DEPLOYMENT

### üß† A. Proxmox Auto-Provisioning

1. Create VM template (Ubuntu, Batocera, or Kiosk OS)
2. Install emulator suite + frontends
3. Store template
4. Clone per guest:

```bash
qm clone 7000 9001 --name arcade1 --full --storage Tardis-Main-Data-2tb
qm set 9001 --net0 virtio,bridge=vmbr0 --memory 4096 --cores 2
qm start 9001
```

### üß† B. Cloud-Init Options (Optional)

* Auto-login
* Load AttractMode/EmulationStation
* Time-limited kiosk VM
* Self-destruct/reset after logout

---

## ‚úÖ SECTION 4: ROM MANAGEMENT & AUDIT

### üß∞ A. Physical to Digital ROM Process

1. Maintain legal cartridge collection
2. Use dumper (e.g. Retrode, GB Operator, Epilogue, or DVD drive)
3. Store under `/mnt/arcade/roms`
4. Generate hash log for auditing:

```bash
sha256sum /mnt/arcade/roms/**/*.zip > rom_hash_log.txt
```

5. Create validation script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
find /mnt/arcade/roms -type f -exec sha256sum {} \; > current_hashes.txt
diff current_hashes.txt rom_hash_log.txt > audit_diff.txt
```

### üîê B. Restrict External Access

* Disable SMB/FTP to `/mnt/arcade/roms` for guests
* Serve only through emulator frontends or kiosk shells

---

## ‚úÖ SECTION 5: KIOSK INTERFACE FOR USERS

### üéÆ A. Steam Deck-Style VMs

* Ubuntu or Batocera-based
* Auto-boot to controller-friendly launcher
* Lock down filesystem (read-only except save states)

```bash
qm stop <vmid> && qm destroy <vmid>
```

### üì∫ B. Frontend Software
